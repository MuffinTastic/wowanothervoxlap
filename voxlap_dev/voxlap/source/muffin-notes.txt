voxlap5 requires assembly to function.
if you're using visual studio 2013 or eclipse, there are plugins out there for MASM. use that to compile v5.asm.

window-related stuff (input, sound, screen, etc) are in WINMAIN.CPP/sysmain.h
platform-independant voxlap engine is in voxlap5.c/voxlap5.h, v5.asm.
kplib deals with filesystem stuff (even from zips!), that might be useful too.

if you make anything, be sure to credit ken silverman, and possibly email him about it!

extension/ is just some simple wrappers around lpoint3d, point3d and dpoint3d that I made. nothing too special.
